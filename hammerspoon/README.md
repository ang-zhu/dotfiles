## Overview
- ### Features
  - **quickly** rearrange your windows – no more dragging!
  - focus windows next to the current one – no more clicking!
  - move windows to other monitors - dragging!

- ### Changes to Caps Lock
  - removes the standard caps lock key capabilities – you'll have to use shift to capitalize letters!
  - caps lock becomes both a new modifier key as well as an alternate escape key

- ### General Usage
  - **tap** caps lock to use the escape character – I'm a Vim user so this is great! even if you don't use Vim, having this set shouldn't really bother you
  - **hold down** caps lock with the varying modifiers I list below for useful functionality
    - note: a lot of these shortcuts are based on Vim usage (e.g. "h" to represent "left")
    - on notation: `caps-w h` means hold down caps, press and release w, press and release h
